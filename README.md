These are a suite of python scripts for bibliographic management using [Freeplane mindmapper](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). 
`busy.py` is a command-line Web scraper that extracts (bibliographic) information from Web pages and store this in varied formats, such as a mindmap. 
It has general heuristics, modular site-specific heuristics, and can use DOI Web services. 
`thunderdell.py` is used to create bibtex/biblatex bibliographies from such mindmaps.

See the online [documentation](http://reagle.org/joseph/2009/01/thunderdell.html) for more.
