These are a suite of python scripts for bibliographic management using [Freeplane mindmapper](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page). `b` is a command-line Web scraper that extracts (bibliographic) information from Web pages and store this in varied formats, such as a mindmap. It has general heuristics, modular site-specific heuristics, and can use DOI Web services. `fe` is used to create bibtex/biblatex bibliographies from such mindmaps.
